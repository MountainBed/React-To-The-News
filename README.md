# React to the News
A `NodeJS`, `MongoDB`, `Express`, and `ReactJS` application. The app has the ability to query the NYT API and list artciles related to a user provided keyword. The user can view these articles later and delete them from their saved list.

Deployed app can be viewed [here](https://radiant-plateau-10598.herokuapp.com/).

## Functionality
##### Backend
The app uses `express` to serve routes and `mongoose` to interact with a `MongoDB` database.

##### Frontend
